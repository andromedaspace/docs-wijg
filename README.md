## About Galt Project

Galt Project is an international decentralized land and real estate property registry governed by DAO (Decentralized autonomous organization) and self-governance protocol for communities of homeowners built on top of Ethereum blockchain.

Creation of property records, resolution of disputes between owners, trading, mortgage, title insurance, and many other operations are performed on smart contracts. Also, property owners can unite in communities for voting, fundraising, and managing the common property.
