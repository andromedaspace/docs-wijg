## Galt Project or John Galt Project or Project

John Galt Project - open-source software for land tokenization (accounting on blockchain) and self-governance in the form of a set of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain, which gives effective tools for any group of people (crypto-enthusiasts, landowners, small nationalities and local tribes):

- buy or use their own Territory of land and raise an investment Fund for its development: the construction of roads, hospitals, schools, the development of the economy by investing in companies and start-ups;
- to divide whole Territory into Land plots between Project participants by auction;
- determine the weight of each Project participant in voting in elections in proportion to the contribution to the fund;
- elect fund managers - Delegates and give them the right to dispose of the Fund's money;
- to make sure that Delegates increase the amount of money in the fund by means of competent investments in infrastructure, companies and people;
- at any time, withdraw the cryptographic keys from the current fund managers and transfer them to another managers;
- at any time, withdraw money from the Fund;
- at any time, split the Fund into several Funds by Project participants voting;
- to regulate the relationship between the Project participants by means of cryptography
- confirm the oneâ€™s right to own or lease a Land plot using cryptography.

## GALT Foundation
Cryptographic organization, multisig 2 to 3, founded and managed by the Project Founders, that defines ideology, development strategy and financing the Project. GALT Foundation receives 5% of GALT tokens from each GALT Territory Genesis  and distributes them among the Project Founders, GALT Foundation Investors and Project Teams. The organization receives 50% of the funds in the Ethers, received by the Territory Entry Operator from the first GALT Territory Genesis.

## GALT
This is the ERC20 token of the Ethereum network. A token is a digitized right to share ownership or disposal of land included in the Project and the equivalent of a share in the investment Fund that is engaged in the development of the Territory in the Project. The token is used to account for how much each Project participant has invested. Using GALT one can win a Land plot on the Land Auction, GALT can be exchanged from the Funds for Ethers at any time. GALT is the share in all Project Territories and in all Project Funds.

## Land plot
Part of the earth's surface that has a fixed boundary.

## SPACE
This is an ERC721 token of the Ethereum network, which corresponds to a specific Land plot. It contains the Geohash of the Land plot. Example: [24qexh](https://explorer.galtproject.io/map/#w24qexh). In fact, this is the right of ownership or disposal of the Land Plot which all Project Participants accept for themselves. The SPACE token can be won at the Land Auction for GALT tokens.
