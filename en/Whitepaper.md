## Abstract
At the heart of any modern society or state lies three social contracts:
1. A set of laws and rules, that define the relationships of members of that society.
2. Private property and the procedure for its accounting.
3. Public budgets, designed to protect property and society Rules.

This system of those basic contracts has several fundamental problems:
1. Private property registries are not secured, they are stored in centralised databases or paper archives. Owners doesnâ€™t control those registries so society need a vast judicial branch to resolve disputes. 
2. Access to the public budget can be usurped.
3. Proccess of creation of Rules is too difficult and also can be usurped.

By creating a Galt Protocol we are trying to solve those problems. 
Galt Protocol is a consistent geospatial registry of land and real estate (which can be used for trading, rental, creating CDP's or taking loans ), system of multisigs for storing and managing public budgets and self-governance and  voting system to define society rules by direct or delegative voting.
