## Abstract
At the heart of any modern society or state lies three social contracts:
1. A set of laws and rules, that define the relationships of members of that society.
2. Private property and the procedure for its accounting.
3. Community budgets, designed to protect property and society Rules.

This system of those basic contracts has several fundamental problems:
1. Private property registries are not secured, they are stored in centralised databases or paper archives. Owners doesnâ€™t control those registries so society need a vast judicial branch to resolve disputes. 
2. Access to the Community budgets can be usurped.
3. Proccess of creation of Rules is too difficult and also can be usurped.

By creating a Galt Protocol we are trying to solve those problems. 
Galt Protocol is a consistent geospatial registry of land and real estate (which can be used for trading, rental, creating CDP's or taking loans ), system of multisigs for storing and managing community budgets and voting system to define society rules by direct or delegative voting. 

### Protocol Overview
Galt Protocol is open - source software powered by Ethereum Blockchain. In Galt Protocol any property owners with the help of  protocol Oracles can create their property token - ERC721 SPACE Token. Each token represents land plot or a part of the building floor and contains geospatial data. Property Owners can:
- create community; 
- create one or several Delegative Community Multisigs; 
- elect multisigs managers; 
- create a set of Community Rules by direct or delegative voting
- make an operations with their property (buy, sell, rent, create CDP, take loans).

### Property Token - ERC721 SPACE Token
The core entity of protocol is a ERC721 standart Ethereum token. Any property owners can pay comission to protocol and Oracles and create his SPACE Token.
Each Token cointains geospatial data. Token Owner can split and merge that geospatial data in the original boundaries without a third party. 
But if Owner want's to change original boundaries he must use the Oracles service.
